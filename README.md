# Castryck-Decru Key Recovery Attack on SIDH

SageMath implementation of [An efficient key recovery attack on SIDH, with Thomas Decru, preliminary version](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975.pdf), based on supplied Magma code from [https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~wcastryc/](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~wcastryc/).

**Sage version**: This was written using SageMath 9.5, and works on the latest stable version: 9.6. I have been told that it doesn't work for 9.2 and below.

## Deviation from Castryck-Decru Attack

Roughly: points are now directly computed rather than derived by solving equations. This means we can avoid the very slow Grobner basis computation which Sage uses.

Deviation can be see in the file `richelot_aux.sage` in the functions: 

* `FromProdToJac()`
* `FromJacToJac()`

Thanks to [RÃ©my Oudompheng](https://twitter.com/oudomphe) for deriving and implementing these algorithms.

## Baby Example

SageMath is significantly slower than Magma for Hyperelliptic computations, and so running the attack on SIKE parameters is still slow. To show the attack working we include `baby_SIDH.sage` which has a smaller prime $p = 2^{33}\*3^{19} - 1$. 

Running `sage baby_SIDH.sage` on a laptop recovers Bob's private key in less than one minute.

## Performance

There is a SageMath performance issue with the group law for the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. When testing equality, the code invokes `GF(p^k)(...)` for all coefficients. The constructor of the Finite Field includes a primality test for ever call, which for larger primes is incredibly expensive.

RÃ©my managed to avoid this by patching SageMath itself, modifying `sage.categories.fields` so that the vector space is cached:

```py
from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method

        @cached_method
        def vector_space(self, *args, **kwds):
            ...
```

A gentler fix is to use `proof.arithmetic(False)`. This still requires constructing the same vector space again and again, but drops the expensive primality test on every call.

However, the easiest fix for fast performance is thanks to [Robin Jadoul](https://ur4ndom.dev). He found that we can achieve a similar result to RÃ©my's Sage patch with the following in-line monkey patch to our finite field by including the line

```py
Fp2.<i> = GF(p^2, modulus=x^2+1)
type(Fp2).vector_space = sage.misc.cachefunc.cached_method(type(Fp2).vector_space)
```

Included below are some estimated times for running the scripts with and without various patches.
